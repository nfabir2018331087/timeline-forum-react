# Timeline Forum
This is a small project built using **React.js**. Here three APIs are given. Each of them contains information about posts, users, and comments respectively.
Different data from the API are merged and shown on a page as a timeline of posts. Each post contains a title, body, author's name (coming from 'users' API), and comments (coming from 'comments' API).
Comments are initially hidden. If the "Show Comments" button is clicked, comments associated with that post are shown and the button changes to a "Hide Comments" button. 

Here is a [**screenshot**](Homepage.png) of the site.
